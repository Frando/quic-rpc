# Quic-Rpc

A streaming rpc system based on quic

## Goals

### Interaction patterns

Provide not just request/response RPC, but also streaming in both directions, similar to [grpc].

- 1 req -> 1 res
- 1 req, update stream -> 1 res
- 1 req -> res stream
- 1 req, update stream -> res stream

It is still a RPC system in the sense that interactions get initiated by the client.

### Transports

- memory transport with very low overhead. In particular, no ser/deser, using mpsc channels from [futures]
- quic transport via the [quinn] crate
- transparent combination of the above

### API

- The API should be similar to the quinn api. Basically "quinn with types".

## Non-Goals

- Cross language interop. This is for talking from rust to rust
- Any kind of verisoning. You have to do this yourself
- Making remote message passing look like local async function calls
- Being runtime agnostic. This is for tokio
